# MediLA (LA Hacks 2020)

### About
With the current state of the crisis (as of March 29, 2020), many resources are slowly becoming unaccesible, such as toilet paper and hand sanitizer. MediLA is a web application, catered towards the elderly or disabled, locating neraby resources that are in stock. When going to a grocery store, there is no telling if resources will be availible. Hence, MediLA keeps track of inventory by updating users real-time, using a Firebase storage. MediLA users are able to see what is currently in stock, and where they would be able to find the resource. This project was created by Oliver Pan, William Tang, and Chinar Kaul for LA Hacks 2020.
